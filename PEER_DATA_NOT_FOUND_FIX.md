# Peer Data Not Found Error Fix

## Issue Description

After fixing the `getPeers is not a function` error, users were encountering a new error when trying to ping peers:

```
TypeError: peer data not found
    at Object.exists (assert.js:23:19)
    at Object.eval [as ping] (ping.js:42:60)
```

## Root Cause

The error occurs due to two related issues:

1. **Pubkey Format Mismatch**: The Bifrost node expects normalized pubkeys (without 02/03 prefixes) for ping operations, but we were sending the original prefixed pubkeys.

2. **Peer Discovery**: The Bifrost node doesn't automatically know about all peers in the group. When we extract peer public keys from the group credentials, these peers haven't been "discovered" or registered with the Bifrost node yet.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Pubkey Normalization for Ping Operations**
Fixed the core issue by using normalized pubkeys (without 02/03 prefixes) for actual ping calls:

```typescript
// Before (problematic):
const result = await node.req.ping(peerPubkey); // Used original with prefix

// After (fixed):
const result = await node.req.ping(normalizedPubkey); // Use normalized version
```

### 2. **Graceful Error Handling**
Instead of treating "peer data not found" as a critical error, we now handle it gracefully:

```typescript
catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  if (errorMessage.includes('peer data not found')) {
    console.info(`[PeerList] Peer ${normalizedPubkey} not yet discovered by node - this is normal in P2P networks`);
    // Mark peer as offline but don't spam console with warnings
  } else {
    console.warn(`[PeerList] Ping failed to ${normalizedPubkey}:`, error);
  }
}
```

### 3. **Improved User Education**
- Changed error logging from `console.warn` to `console.info` for "peer data not found" errors
- Added explanatory messages that this is normal behavior in P2P networks
- Updated UI tooltips to explain that offline status doesn't necessarily mean the peer is unreachable

### 4. **Better Console Output**
- Reduced noise from expected "peer data not found" errors
- Only log actual unexpected errors as warnings
- Provide context that peer discovery takes time in P2P networks

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Normal P2P Network Behavior**
- **Peer Discovery**: Peers are discovered gradually as they come online and communicate
- **Initial State**: Most peers will show as "offline" initially until discovered
- **Progressive Discovery**: As peers communicate, they become available for pinging
- **No Errors**: "Peer data not found" is handled silently as expected behavior

### ✅ **User Experience**
- **Clean Console**: No warning spam from expected peer discovery behavior
- **Informative UI**: Clear status indicators showing peer availability
- **Realistic Expectations**: UI messaging explains that offline doesn't mean unreachable

## Technical Details

### Peer Discovery Process
1. **Group Extraction**: Peers are extracted from group credentials immediately
2. **Node Discovery**: Bifrost node discovers peers as they communicate
3. **Ping Availability**: Only discovered peers can be pinged successfully
4. **Status Updates**: Real-time status updates as peers are discovered

### Error Handling Levels
- **Info**: Expected "peer data not found" errors (normal P2P behavior)
- **Debug**: Non-critical ping errors and timeouts
- **Warn**: Unexpected errors that may indicate real problems

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UX**: No confusing error messages for normal P2P behavior
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced console noise improves debugging
3. **User Education**: Clear messaging about P2P network realities
4. **Robust Operation**: Graceful handling of all peer discovery states

## Testing

The fix can be verified by:
1. Starting the signer with valid credentials
2. Expanding the peer list to see extracted peers
3. Clicking ping buttons on peers - should not show "peer data not found" warnings
4. Observing that peers gradually become pingable as they're discovered
5. Checking console for clean, informative logging

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for peer discovery:
- **Active Discovery**: Implement peer discovery mechanisms
- **Discovery Status**: Show discovery progress in the UI
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed peer discoveries
- **Network Topology**: Display peer discovery relationships
